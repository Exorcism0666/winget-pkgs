  Release Notes
  âœ¨ Highlights
  This release introduces lazily creating solve environments for the pypi-dependencies resulting in a significant speed-up for environments that only depend on wheels. If you want to force the use of wheels you can now also set no-build in the pypi-options table. To test this you can now just use pixi lock to create a lockfile without installing an environment.
